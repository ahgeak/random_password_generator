# Random Password Generator

## Description
This project creates a random password for the user. When clicking hte button, the user will be prompted to provide the password length between 8-128 characters long. Next the user will be asked to select password criteria characters. The user must select at least one or the program will alert the user they must select one criteria type. Once criteria are selected the user will be given a random password of the correct length with the selected characters.

Through this project I learned how to use querySelectors, usinging and updating arrays, how to create and all functions, and local versus globally scoped variables. This project solves the need for a user to create a random password given a set of criteria.

## Usage
